| April 5      |      9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 11 |  9:40 - 9:55 am  |                                                                                                          I started thinking about the code and how I wanted to develop my work. I mainly just went over m notes on how connections work on LinkedIn for example, where you are looking at the second layer. In this circumstance, I want to find the city with the most "mutuals", and build a hospital there. |
| September 12 |  2:05 - 2:35 pm  |        I kind of just vibe coded for a bit. But thinking about this conceptually I want to go through the first column of the cities array and if the cities are connected, add them to an array. This way I can find the different clusters of cities. From there, I want each cluster to be connected by n - 1 highways and 1 hospital. That part is much easier than finding the amount of clusters though. |
| September 14 |  7:15 - 7:35 pm  | I mainly spent this time researching Prims algorithm which was mentioned last class. What I found is that Prims algorithm is good for exactly what this problem looks for: finding the lowest cost by using a hospital super node and making the optimal route for certain cities (nodes). I wasn't fully able to figure out how the algorithm itself worked, but I will make an attempt when I sit down next. |
| September 15 |   8:30 - 10 pm   |                            I was talking to Gemini about Prims and I came across the concept of an adjacency list. After looking it up, I found a graph class which seemed perfect for the code I was trying to perform. The next steps in my code is to figure out how to track the amount of clusters and how many cities are in each cluster. From there I can calculate the costs easily. Big progression! |
| September 22 |  9:05 - 9:55am   |                                                                 I applied what we learned in class to develop the union find algorithm. I did this by iterating through each edge, and then finding the root of each node, and as long as they are not equal, setting them equal to one another. My next step is to make functional code that passes the test, and then to try and work towards optimizations. |
| September 22 | 10:15 - 11:40 pm |                                                       I spent a lot of time finishing up the union find algorithm. I realized that I needed a seperate map to track the sizes of each tree to incorporate the weight balancing aspect. I don't know how efficient my code is, but I do feel good about understanding the algorithm. I wonder whether you can solve this problem with only 1 map instead of 2.  |
